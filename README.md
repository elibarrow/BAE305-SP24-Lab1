# Lab Report 1: Knowing Your Instruments

Jan. 10, 2024


## Summary of Lab
The project goal of this lab was to become comfortable with the lab equipment that we will be using all semester, we experiemented with a power supply, oscilliscope, a function generator, and a Fluke DMM. We began the lab by determining the expected, maximum, and minimum values of resistors using the Fluke DMM. We then did the same type of experimenting with Capacitors to find the expected, maximum, and minimum capacitance of each capacitor we were given. Next we began to work with the o-scope, function generator and power supply to run various different tests. By the end of the lab I am certain that Issac and I are definetley more comfortable using the lab equipment now than before beginning the lab.


## Lab Assignment Specific Items
***Question 1:***   

*Resistor Measurements*
| Color Code | Expected Resistnace k&Omega; | MAX | MIN | Measured | Range |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---:|
|   Red-Black-Red-Gold     | 2   |2.1 | 1.9 | 1.966 | In Range |
| Brown-Red-Yellow-Gold    | 120 |126 | 114 | 120.20| In Range |
| Brown-Black-Ornage-Gold  | 10  |10.5| 9.5 | 9.9   | In Range |
| Orange-Orange-Green-Gold |3300 |3465 |3135 | 3500 | Out of Range |

*a.) If you subtract this value to the previously measured, do the reistors fall within their tolerance?*   
If we consider the expected, minimum and maximum values for these resistors we can see that all of them are in the expected range except for the 3300 k&Omega; resistor.  
      


***Question 2:***   

*Capacitor Measurements*
| Color| Type | Expected Capacitance pF; | MAX | MIN | Measured pF| Range |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---:|
|   blue   | ceramic      |10000      | 10000.25 | 9999.75 | 10200         | In Range |
| yellow   | ceramic      |1000       | 1100     | 900     | 1300          | In Range |
| black    | electrolytic | 100000000 | ---      | ---     | 97900000      | In Range |
| blue     | electrolytic | 100000000 |---       | ---     | 106000000     | Out of Range |

*a.) Do the instruments agree with the expected value?*  
Yes they agree with the values for the most part, the values are a little off but that is becuase the values are so small and our Fluke DMM may not be able to accuratley measure at that precision.

*b.) Does the polarity affect the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor?*    
Yes, it does affect the measurements of the electrolytic capacitors but not enough to really alter our values.


***Question 3:***   

*Measurements of Power Supply*
| Expected Voltage (V) |  Actual Voltage (V)| 
|:---|:---:|
|1.50    |1.478 |
|7       | 6.95 |
|12      | 11.94 |
|3.3     | 3.396 |
|5       | 5.171 |
|12      | 12.01 |

*Discussion Question 1: Do the instruments agree with each other? Why?*  
Yes, they agree with one another but there is obviously a little bit of error/resistance in the wires that we are using the measure the values with.

***Question 4***   

   
*Working with the O-scope*

|  |  Frequency (kHz)|  Voltage (V)|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|1   |1.913 |8.25|
|2     | 1.826 |9.28|
|3     | 1.738 |9.12|
|4     | 1.73 |6.2|









This report includes text and also figures that I linked from my repository.
Like this:

Or perhaps a nicer smaller, centered image like this (using html):

</p>

Also I can include math functions like this:

$$V(V) = I(A)*R(&Omega;)$$

$$P = I^2*R$$

Also I have to include code like this:

```c++
void recvWithEndMarker() {
    static byte ndx = 0;
    char endMarker = '\n';
    char rc;
    
    while (mySerial.available() > 0 && newData == false) {
        rc = mySerial.read();

        if (rc != endMarker) {
            receivedChars[ndx] = rc;
            ndx++;
            if (ndx >= numChars) {
                ndx = numChars - 1;
            }
        }
        else {
            receivedChars[ndx] = '\0'; // terminate the string
            ndx = 0;
            newData = true;
        }
    }
}
```
Also I can make **bold** and *emphatic* statements and add tables like this:

| Variable | Value |
|:---:|---|
|   V      | 5 V   |
| R        | 1 k&Omega; |
| I        | 5 mA  |
